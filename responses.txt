I have 4 years of SQL development experience, with lots of complex and large database queries
I've used a little bit of Tableau for some dashboards
I use Python pretty much every day
My bachelors is in Math
I've worked on telecomm business analysis, and provided KPI data on how my team's spam detection Machine Learning model is doing
I've collaborated with lots of people on my own team and on other teams too. That's a regular part of my job
I do this all the time
Super fast paced environment on my team now
I'm flexible, and people might say I'm positive
